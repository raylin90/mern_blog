        <h1>Ray Lin</h1>
        <p>I recently completed an intensive 14 weeks coding boot camp, which helped me to enhance my knowledge of three full stack (Python; Java; and MERN) software development. I really enjoy learning new things; constantly seeking out new learning opportunities, and I really look forward to a company where I can combine my experience and share my skills. </p>
